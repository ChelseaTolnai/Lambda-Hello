Hello Lambda! My name is Chelsea Tolnai (Chelsea Kasperowicz).

I am: Male, Single, Fifty-Two.

One of my favorite hobbies is fire breathing.
It is a thrilling activity because it does require a lot of skills to not get hurt.
I also enjoy it because it appeals to my dangerous personality.
Hooray Fire Breathers!

*EXTRA* Amend: The above is my alternate reality bio.
I am actually Female, Married, Twenty-Six. One of my hobbies is crocheting.
